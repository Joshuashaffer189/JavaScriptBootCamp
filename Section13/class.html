    <p class="taylor">I didn't know what I would find
        When I went looking for a reason,
        I know I didn't read between the lines
        And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
        
        I tried to take the road less traveled by
        But nothing seems to work the first few times
        Am I right?
        
        So how can I ever try to be better?
        Nobody ever lets me in
        I can still see you.
        This ain't the best view
        On the outside looking in
        And I've been a lot of lonely places
        I've never been on the outside
